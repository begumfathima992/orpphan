You work hard and it is an added blessing if you can help a deserving child for his/her livelihood. We cannot help everyone, but every one of us can help someone in need.
                             Every rupee you donate helps a child feel better, eat better and study further. Few of us can help them by being physically present but most people are surrounded by a hectic lifestyle.
                              You can always contribute by sending us a donation, how much ever you think you can. Little drops of water do make a large ocean. You can help by contributing just INR 1800 a month.
                               This will help us with:

                               <p>We do not have a lot of sponsors right now and we would love to be associated with people like you. While INR 1800 is the cost people pay for a dinner these days,
                                    it will help a child stay comfortable and protected the whole month.
                                    Our kids get overjoyed when people come forward to sponsor them. Just the feeling of knowing that someone from around the world is caring for them gives them immense joy and encouragement.
                                     There is more happiness always in giving people in need. You can change the life of a kid and ensure a healthier future for him/her by contributing.</p>

Education not only helps get a career, it also helps in social skills and overall holistic development. This is why we give utmost importance to the quality of education our students get.
                             All the kids with us go to a full time educational institution and study every day. 
                             Every kid around us deserves good education and the opportunity to better in life
                             using it. Education empowers them, gives them necessary confidence to face life and helps them financially and morally until the end.
                              With quality education and good teachers around, our children continue to grow better and evolve as good citizens of the country. Spending for education is an investment in every sense. Keeping this in mind,
                               we have chosen good institutes for our children to learn from.
                                Books, school fees, tuition fees, uniforms etc. are always on our priority list.</p>

<p>On an average, it costs around INR 1000 per month for one child to go to school and
     this includes school fees,
     transportation, notebooks and textbooks, stationeries and tuition fees. 
     Let us know if you will like to sponsor a childâ€™s education.</p>

Therefore, we all deserve to celebrate the day we were born. We know the birthdays of few children with us, while we have no idea about the same for others. For kids like this, we have chosen a day to celebrate their birthday and aim to do it with joy and fun. A lot of loving people come to our shelter to celebrate their birthdays and our kids were all excited about it. We thought they deserve to celebrate their birthday too. We post on our Facebook and WhatsApp pages about the birthday details of each kid. A lot of people wish them over social media and few even call us up to wish the birthday child. The amount of happiness this gives the children cannot be described by words. From the year 2016, we also mention the birthday dates of the children on our yearly calendar which you can refer to. You can sponsor to celebrate the birthday of our kids. The total cost comes to around INR 4000 for one celebration.
                             This will include:</p>
